		<h2 class="cv">Professional Experience</h2>
		<hr />
			<h3 class="cv">Wireless System Engineer - May. 2021 - Present</h3>
				<h4 class="cv">BLiNQ Networks - Markham, ON</h4>
				<ul class="cv">
					<li>Currently developing a spectrum controller, responsible for the frequency assignment among a small cell 
						network (it uses a network graph with information about each device and its neighbor relations to find 
						the channel allocation that maximizes the network capacity). Formulated the optimization problem, defining 
						the system constraints based on hardware limitation and spectrum availability, and designed an interference 
						metric that is fed into the network graph.</li>
					<li>Formulated and validated through simulations the frequency selection algorithm for LAA operation 
						(i.e., joint CBRS and unlicensed spectrum) and assisted the software engineering team on its implementation. 
						The algorithm is responsible for ranking and selecting the best channel in the unlicensed spectrum band 
						(UNII band) and tracking the interference levels in the operational channel so that high interference can 
						trigger channel changes.</li>
					<li>Developed the channel-aware scheduler algorithm for carrier aggregation and proposed modifications to the company's 
						existing scheduler. Provided major contributions to the UE selection algorithm, responsible for selecting the 
						set of UEs for transmission in each TTI and assigning them to a combination of licensed and unlicensed channels,
						resulting in up to 17% increase in throughput and up to 10% increase in fairness compared to existing algorithm.</li>
					<li>Investigated and documented 3GPP 5G-New Radio (NR) functionalities (including topics such as waveform, numerology, 
						radio frame structure, bandwidth parts, dynamic scheduling, reference signals, control signaling, uplink enhancements,
						NR-unlicensed, and integrated access and backhaul) and presented the findings in cross-functional meetings with 
						management and software engineers. Also documented existing features in the company's PHY/MAC software 
						(including user selection, scheduling, and link adaptation) to assist software engineers.</li>
