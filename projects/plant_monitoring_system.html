				In the era of smart homes and automation, nurturing your plants has become a tech-savvy endeavor. 
				In this project, I explore a captivating maker project â€” a Plant Monitoring System that not only let me keep a vigilant eye on my plants' well-being 
				but also incorporates a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.
				This intelligent system, built around an ESP32 S2 mini, capacitive soil moisture sensors, and the DHT22 sensor, 
				seamlessly integrates with Home Assistant for an enhanced plant care experience.
