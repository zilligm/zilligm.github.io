	<h1>3GPP Channel Models</h1>

	<a href="https://github.com/zilligm/py3gppchannels">Go to project repository</a>
      
	<p>The 3GPP Channel Models Python library is a comprehensive package that implements the 3GPP standardized radio channel models. 
	These models are widely used in the telecommunications industry to simulate wireless communication systems and evaluate their performance.
      	</p>

      	<p>The library includes functions for generating channel impulse response (CIR), delay spread, path loss, and shadow fading. 
      	It supports various scenarios, including urban, suburban, rural, and indoor environments, with options to customize model parameters such as 
      	frequency, distance, and antenna height.
      	</p>

      	<p>The 3GPP Channel Models library is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing developers to integrate it seamlessly into their 
      	simulation or testing frameworks. With this library, users can simulate wireless communication scenarios under realistic channel conditions 
      	and evaluate the performance of their systems in terms of metrics such as bit error rate, throughput, and signal-to-noise ratio.
